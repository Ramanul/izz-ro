# STATE — project execution state

> Single source of truth for "where we are". Manager-owned; updated at the end of every slice.
> Executors get it read-only. Keep it tight — when it outgrows ~40 lines of content, cut the
> settled history, not the open work. `git fetch` immediately before rewriting it.

**Updated:** 2026-08-02 (account A landed the three draft PRs B left when it hit the limit)

## OPERATING MODE — owner active on ACCOUNT A (2026-08-02)
Owner was on account B, hit the usage limit mid-work on three draft PRs, switched to account A
(this local session) to continue. Per §14 (amended): **the account the owner is working from
merges** — that is account A now. All three PRs landed here; see "Merged 2026-08-01/02".

## SIRUTA — sourced, MEASURED, village-level BLOCKED on county-aware matching (2026-08-02)
Groundwork committed (branch `claude/siruta-groundwork`, NOT merged): `data/siruta_raw.csv`
(official SIRUTA via github.com/andrei-furnica/localitati-romania → data.gov.ro; cp1250, `;`,
comma decimals) + `tools/build_gazetteer.py`. **geo.py is UNCHANGED — still the safe primării CSV.**
- SIRUTA holds 42 counties + 3181 UATs + 13755 villages. Of villages, 8736 names are globally
  unique, ~5019 collide (POIANA×38, "SATU NOU"×42 — hopeless without source county).
- **Measured on the live corpus: adding even the unique villages REGRESSES the gate.** 49 articles
  wrongly became `local`: "Saturn retrograd" (Saturn is a Black-Sea resort/village), the horoscope,
  "Senatul... decarbonizarea", "FCSB vs FK Auda". A unique village name can still be a common word.
- Conclusion: village-level geo needs **source-county disambiguation** (a Vrancea paper's "Poiana"
  = Poiana-Vrancea), i.e. plumb the source's county into `geo.clasifica`. That is the real Slice 2.
  Naive addition is a regression, so it was NOT shipped (owner methodology: measure, don't ship
  below the bar). UAT-only switch also churned 155 classifications vs the primării CSV — not a
  clean win either. Reference features (Bucegi, Ceahlău, Dunărea) are a separate small curated list.

## Open
1. **Owner decision pending:** `BATCH_SIZE` 6→10 gives ~+67% articles per run but risks JSON
   truncation unless `maxOutputTokens` (2048, hardcoded) rises with it.
2. **Bug, found and NOT fixed:** ~129 official sources are re-fetched every run and expired by
   `state.expire()` in the *same* run — 76% of their content is already past the 7-day TTL when
   read. No AI cost, but wasted fetch and **falsified stats**: a log read "B: 437" when the real
   commit diff was +14 URLs.
3. **Guides still carry placeholder figures.** `data/entities/*.yaml` all have `verificat: false`
   (correct — the pages honestly show "Neconfirmat"). Setting any to `true` needs a real figure +
   a deep-link `sursa_url`; the sandbox cannot reach RO domains, so this is the OWNER's to fill.
   NOTE: the 2 local test failures on this were a STALE `output/` from Jul 19, not a code bug —
   `--render-only` clears them, main is green (177 tests). Do not "fix" the template; it is correct.
4. **Owner-requested, not started:** primării organized on a MAP by historical region → county →
   commune; pull news down to village/UAT level (SIRUTA). Big multi-slice project, needs the owner.

## Settled today — do NOT re-derive
- **The "too few articles" cause was an outage, not the budget.** 30 consecutive `pipeline` runs
  failed 21 Jul 17:40 → 24 Jul 03:37 UTC with `AI DOWN — HTTP 400`: Gemini's `-latest` alias
  repointed to a 3.x model that rejects `thinkingConfig`. Fixed by `d56a8db` (#76); green since.
  The 40- and 92-article days were outage days; 198 was the recovery day, with a TTL expiry spike.
- **Real production budget:** `MAX_AI_CALLS_PER_RUN=18` and `UPGRADE_RESERVE=8` (both set in
  `build.yml`, so the 12/3 defaults in `main.py` are dead in production) → **10 calls/run for new
  articles**. Model B yields 6 articles/call, model C yields 1 (its value is de-duplication).
  Measured against 741 new items available per run: the call budget is the real ceiling.
- **Gemini's free tier is NOT saturated:** ~1000 requests/day per key against our max 216/day.
  `GEMINI_API_KEY` already supports multiple keys with failover (`gemini.py:30-42`), so a second
  key is free headroom. Full provider comparison in `specs/ai-provider-capacity.md`; Groq ranks
  first as a *failure* backup, not a capacity multiplier.
- **The sandbox CAN reach the live site and PR previews.** `https://izz.ro/` returns 200, and
  `https://<branch>.izz-ro.pages.dev/` works. Used to prove before/after on real deploys. News
  sites remain proxy-blocked — that limit is separate and still real. CLAUDE.md §16.3 rewritten.
- **feedcheck's 74 "dead" sources were not a code bug.** Same code, 15 minutes apart, gave 1 vs
  74; four of them fetched fine from here with both old and new implementations. Pattern points
  at transient host-side limiting on shared GitHub runner IPs. Unproven mechanism — do not state
  it as fact. #93 is justified anyway: checker and production could silently diverge.
- **"Alive from the sandbox" says nothing about runner reachability.** `pl_vaslui_tacuta`:
  200 with 10 entries here, 403 from runners twice. Dropped in #90 because `build.yml` pulls from
  those runners. Judge every source from the vantage point production uses.
- **Sub-agents cost ~5.6x per delivered line** (129 vs 23 tokens/100 lines, measured over 21
  slices in `COORD-DASHBOARD.md`). Worth it for genuinely parallel or noisy measurement work.
  CI is the cheapest executor — free minutes on a public repo, and the only one with real network.

## Merged 2026-08-01/02 (account A, from B's draft PRs)
- **#96** — dark-mode toggle was dead on live: CSP `script-src 'self'` (no `unsafe-inline`)
  refused the inline `onclick` + `<script>`; worked locally only because `http.server` skips
  `_headers`. Moved to external `static/theme.js` (event delegation, cache-busted). **Verified on
  the branch preview with real CSP**: toggle flips `data-theme`, persists, zero console/CSP errors.
- **#99** — geographic section decided from article TEXT, not an AI guess (`generator/geo.py`):
  region→regional, county→zonal, locality→local, most-specific wins, no place name → stays on
  topic. Fixes the "Swiss village under regional" leak. 28 geo tests incl. the real triggers.
- **#97** — CLAUDE.md §19 session hygiene + §14b bounded background work. §18 numbering collided
  with main's institution-images section; resolved (kept both, hygiene→§19), merged via main.

## Merged 2026-07-25 (prior session)
#86 reviewers could not read code (failed on every PR) · #87 131 articles stranded on the old
geographic category · #88 cadence docs + reviewers no longer gate on quota · #89 `/surse/` shows
all 189 sources instead of 2 links · #90 freed the slot held by an unreachable source ·
#91 dark-mode contrast (305 hidden pa11y errors), sticky subnav, PWA name + its cache-bust ·
#92 agent runs quantified, report timestamped.

## Blockers
- MAI WAF blocks `*.prefectura.mai.gov.ro` from this IP (502). Retest from Actions.
- Cloudflare free plan ~500 builds/month is why `build.yml` runs every 2h (`13 */2`). Do not
  raise the frequency — see CLAUDE.md §17.
